# AsyncTelegram2
A modified copy of theAsyncTelegram2 library allows you to send text files and pictures to the Telegram chat.
In the SPIFFS memory ESP you need to load files from the data folder using the arduino environment, 
fill in the data wifi network and telegram token in the program and then in response to a request to the bot it will send to the chat a picture and a text file.
