# AsyncTelegram2
A modified copy of theAsyncTelegram2 library allows you to send text files and pictures to the Telegram chat.
In the SPIFFS memory ESP you need to load files from the data folder using the arduino environment, 
fill in the data wifi network and telegram token in the program and then in response to a request to the bot it will send to the chat a picture and a text file.









This library is the successor to the AsyncTelegram library.
It was chosen to change the name in addition to the major version to mark clearly a breaking point.
AsyncTelegram2 is now no longer tied to the Espressif ESP8266 / ESP32 hardware, but can virtually work with any MCU capable of a SSL connection and with any kind of transport layer like WiFi, Ethernet, GSM module (still to be tested).

When dealing with IoT systems, connection security is often an underestimated issue.
Due to this reason in AsyncTelegram2 insecure connections or verification method based on the server fingerprint (not strong secure, and moreover with short validity, typically 1 year) are no longer internally supported.

However, since you need to pass an HTTP client reference to the library, connect to Telegram with unsecure or fingerprint verified connections it's still possible on sketch side.

Could be useful check this gist for a way to get updated fingerprint of any HTTPS webservice or website: [get_https_fingerprint.ino](https://gist.github.com/cotestatnt/570f882e19f12490304d4d217aa1d8af)

### Introduction
AsyncTelegram2 is an Arduino class for managing Telegram Bot on embedded system.
Don't you know Telegram bots and how to setup one? Check [this](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

When you add the possibility to send a message from your IoT application to a Telegram Bot, this should be only an additional "features" and not the core of your firmware.
Unfortunately, most of Telegram libraries, stucks your micro while communicating with the Telegram Server in order to read properly the response and parse it.

AsyncTelegram2 do this job in async way and not interfee with the rest of code!

It relies on [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) v6 library so, in order to use a AsyncTelegram2 object, you need to install the ArduinoJson library first.

With Ethernet adapter, i wold suggest to use this library for secure connection [SSLClient](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/SSLClient), a BearSSL based library wich is very light and fast.

+ **this library work with ArduinoJson library V6.x _**

### Features
+ Send and receive non-blocking messages to Telegram bot ([formatting HTML or Markdown V2 supported](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#formatting-options), disable notification mode supported)
+ Send picture both from url and from any kind of filesystem (SPIFFS, LittleFS, FFAT, SD etc etc )
+ Inline keyboards (with support for callback function)
+ Reply keyboards 
+ Receive localization messages
+ Receive contacts messages 
+ Remote OTA updates (examples only for Espressif's MCU)
+ Forward any kind of message to user or group
+ Checking message delivery with a notification callback function 

### To do
+ Send documents (partially done with pictures)

### Supported boards
The library works virtually with any kind of board capable of SSL connection.

### Simple and responsive usage
Take a look at the examples provided in the [examples folder](https://github.com/cotestatnt/AsyncTelegram2/tree/master/examples).

### Reference
[Here how to use the library](https://github.com/cotestatnt/AsyncTelegram2/blob/master/REFERENCE.md). 

+ 2.0.0   Initial version, most of functionality of AsyncTelegram
+ 2.0.1   Added more overload functions to cover a lot of possible usage and mantain a little backward compatibility
+ 2.0.2   Increased upload speed. Now is possible send photo directly from a raw data buffer (e.g. ESP32-CAM)
+ 2.0.3   Added support for [custom commands](https://core.telegram.org/bots#commands) (`getMyCommands()`, `setMyCommands()`, `deleteMyCommands()`)
+ 2.0.5   Bug fixes
+ 2.0.6   Added support in TBmessage struct for handling event related to add/remove users from groups
+ 2.0.7   Added support for "send message" callback function
+ 2.0.8   Bot will reply ever in the originates message chat (user or group), bug fixes in checking sent messages routines
+ 2.1.0
